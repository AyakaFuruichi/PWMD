            <p>
                Nijisanji (にじさんじ) is an online Japanese video sharing social networking service for iPhone X.[1][2] It is a group of mostly Live2D-only Virtual YouTubers who are also known as "Virtual Livers" (バーチャルライバー Bācharu Raibā) when posting on sites outside of YouTube, such as NicoNico Douga, Twitch and Bilibili. The term Liver, coined by mixing Japanese and English, is a heteronym for calling Nijisanji's streamers.
